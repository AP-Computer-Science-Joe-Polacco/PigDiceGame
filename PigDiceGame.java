/**
 * The game of Pig is a simple two-player dice game in which the first player to
 * reach 100 or more points wins. Players take turns. On each turn, a player rolls a
 * six-sided die:
 * 1. If the player rolls a 1, then the player gets no new points and it becomes the other
 *    player’s turn.
 * 2. If the player rolls 2 through 6, then he or she can either ROLL AGAIN or
 *    HOLD. At this point, the sum of all rolls is added to the player’s score, and it
 *    becomes the other player’s turn.
 *    
 * Write a program that plays the game of Pig, where one player is a human and the
 * other is the computer. When it is the human’s turn, the program should show the
 * score of both players and the previous roll. Allow the human to input “r” to roll
 * again or “h” to hold.
 * 
 * The computer program should play according to the following rule:
 * 
 * Keep rolling when it is the computer’s turn until it has accumulated 20 or
 * more points, then hold. If the computer wins or rolls a 1, then the turn ends
 * immediately.
 * 
 * Allow the human to roll first.
